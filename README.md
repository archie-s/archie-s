# Hi, I’m Joyce 👋🏽

I’m a Software Engineer and builder who enjoys turning real-world problems into practical, scalable software.  
I’m especially interested in **AI-powered systems**, **web platforms**, and **tech that creates real impact**.

I like working at the intersection of **engineering, product, and creativity**—building things that are useful, well-designed, and thoughtfully documented.

## 🚀 What I work on
- **AI & Data-driven applications**  
  Predictive systems, forecasting models, and intelligent dashboards.
- **Full-stack web development**  
  Building APIs, dashboards, and user-facing platforms from backend to frontend.
- **Applied tech for real problems**  
  Projects in healthcare, supply chains, events and community-driven platforms.
- **Experimental & learning projects**  
  Exploring new tools, frameworks, and architectural patterns.

Some projects you’ll find here include:
- AI-assisted platforms for forecasting and decision-making  
- Full-stack apps with modern frontend frameworks  
- Prototypes, case studies, and academic/side projects
